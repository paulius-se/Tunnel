# Tunnel

Simple network filter for the Internet.

The filter is implemented purely in GO and based on Tun interface.
Currently supports Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1). Support for Mac OS X and Windows is also possible, but Tun interface  and routing setups are different for each OS and not implemented yet.

Rules are specified in a text file lines in the following format:

<addresses to limit in CIDR> <limit value><limit unit>

e.g.

0.0.0.0/0 10s           - allow TCP connection everywhere for 10 seconds
94.142.241.111/32 1mb   - allow download of 1 megabyte using IP packets from 94.142.241.111

Supported limit units:

kb, mb, gb - number kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes computer is allowed to download from an addresses using IP packets.
s, m, h - number of seconds, minutes or hours computer is allowed to access specified addresses using TCP protocol.


# Build

In order to build, run the following commands in terminal:

1. install dependecies

    $ go get ./...
    
2. make a build

    $ go build .

The output file should appear as 'tunnel'.


# Prerequisities

Add the routing table entry to /etc/iproute2/rt_tables: 

200 Tun

$ cat /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
```
#
# reserved values
#
255	local
254	main
253	default
0	unspec
#
# local
#
#1	inr.ruhep

200	Tun
```

# Run

To run the network filter:

$ sudo ./tunnel -r rules.txt

Note: 'sudo' is required to make Tun interface and routing setup.


# Usage examples

Provided rule set file rules.txt contains the following IP addresses in CIDR notation

0.0.0.0/0 30s           - allows access to any IP address for 30 seconds
172.217.21.132/32 2m    - allows access to www.google.com (172.217.21.132) for 2 minutes
80.249.99.148/32 11mb   - allows to download 11 megabytes of data from ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com (80.249.99.148)

Run the following commands:

1. $ curl http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip --output 5mb.zip

This will activate the rule '80.249.99.148/32 11mb'. Tunnel CLI will output to console the following:

Parsed rules from rules.txt
#0 0.0.0.0/0 10s
#1 172.217.21.132/32 2m
#2 80.249.99.148/32 11mb
Setup interface:  tun0
Status:
write packet for 80.249.99.148, 5484083 of 11534336 bytes transfered for rule #2

When data transfer limit reached the CLI blocks the IP address and output to console:

Status:
80.249.99.148 limit 11534336 bytes reached for rule #2

2. $ curl www.google.com

The rule '172.217.21.132/32 2m' will be activated.

Parsed rules from rules.txt
#0 0.0.0.0/0 30s
#1 172.217.21.132/32 2m
#2 80.249.99.148/32 11mb
Setup interface:  tun0
Status:
write packet for 172.217.21.132, 6 of 120 sec time passed for rule #1

When specified time ellapsed tunnel CLI blocks access to the IP address and will output to console:

Status:
172.217.21.132 limit 120 sec reached for rule #1
